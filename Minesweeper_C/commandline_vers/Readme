This version of my Minesweeper program runs on C

The version is played on the command line, the display and inputs are shown there
only typing is requierd to play

To play, either compile with and then enter ./minesweeper 
or enter ./run to do both

The powershell sceipt file and makefile are set for Windows 10
if you plan to run this on linux/mac be sure to modify those to do so
