# Minesweeper-Project
Repo for my minesweeper project

The main goal is to have a command line version of minesweeper that is implemented in several different coding languages.
This main command line iteration of minesweeper should behave the same across these different languages, setting a standard for them.

There might also be alternate graphical variants of the minesweeper game, which can add to or change the method of displaying the game graphically (and how a player gives inputs).
These variants will likely be language exclusive, so the changes will not be the same across different languages.

For compilation, these are all intended to be ran on Windows (specifically Windows 10).
I will provide a powershell script to either compile, or compile and run the code properly.
For certain languages, like C++ and C, an accopmying compiling file might be present (like a makefile).
These will also be calibrated for Windows 10.
